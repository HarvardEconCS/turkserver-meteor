# Getting Started

See the [Quick Start](https://github.com/VirtualLab/turkserver-meteor). Once the package is installed, you should be able to start your Meteor app and navigate to `/turkserver` to see the admin interface.

Be sure to also check out the [guide](http://turkserver.github.io). 

# API Reference

JSDoc-style comments in the code are automatically processed and included
below. This can change quite a bit as we approach a stable release. Some API
functions aren't yet documented, so [please
contribute](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/turkserver-meteor)!
