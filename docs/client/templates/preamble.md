# Getting Started

See the [guide](http://turkserver.readthedocs.io/). Once the package
is installed, you should be able to start your Meteor app and navigate
to `/turkserver` to see the admin interface.

# API Reference

JSDoc-style comments in the code are automatically processed and included
below. This can change quite a bit as we approach a stable release. Some API
functions aren't yet documented, so [please
contribute](https://github.com/TurkServer/turkserver-meteor)!
