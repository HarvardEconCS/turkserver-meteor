turkserver-meteor
=================

Implementation of the [TurkServer](https://github.com/HarvardEconCS/TurkServer) functionality as a plugin for the mind-blowing [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) web app framework, allowing any Meteor app to be run on MTurk. The point? Online experiments just became 10x easier to create.
