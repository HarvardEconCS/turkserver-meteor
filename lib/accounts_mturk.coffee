  Add a hook to Meteor's login system:

  for users who are not currently assigned to a HIT.

  # This is a bit fail-prone due to leaking sessions across HCR, so take it out.
#  if info.user? and UserStatus.connections.findOne(userId: info.user._id)
#    throw new Meteor.Error(403, "You already have this open in another window. Complete it there.")

  Returns an assignment object corresponding to the assignment.
